## 🚀 What We Do

BubbleTax is a private project built by developers for developers and traders. Our mission:

- Import broker transaction data (especially IBKR) and generate tax reports that are **compliant with German regulations** (BMF writing as of May 2025). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Handle complex cases: foreign‑currency conversion, FIFO lot matching, separation of different asset types (stocks, options, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Provide a trustworthy and transparent tool — open process, clearly documented logic, no hidden fees.

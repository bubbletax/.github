## 🚀 What We Do

BubbleTax is a project built by developers for developers and traders. Our mission:

- Import broker transaction data (especially IBKR) and generate tax reports that are **compliant with German regulations** (BMF writing as of May 2025).
- Handle complex cases: foreign‑currency conversion, FIFO lot matching, separation of different asset types (stocks, options, etc.).
- Offer a tool with trustworthy, transparent logic — clearly documented, no hidden fees, and with respect for users' needs.
